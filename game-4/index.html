        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>Originality:</strong>
                What is original about your game? It blends the asteriods idea with an inverted catching game to create a reall challenge to stay alive.
            </li>

            <li>
                <strong>Technical Merit:</strong>
                What is interesting about your game technology? getting all the collisions of things to interact correctly while also creating infinite supply of some objects while making sure all the sprites play nice.
            </li>

            <li>
                <strong>Prototype Postmortem:</strong>
                What did you learn from this prototype? that javascript is hard and I have a lot to learn, their are 3 ways to do something in phaser based on how you want to impliment it.
                What was the easiest or hardest part of making it? getting the meteors to fall in a random pattern as a group system, then also getting the meteors and lazers to work together.
            </li>

            <li>
                <strong>Prototype Assets:</strong>
                Did you make your prototype assets from scratch? Did you borrow them? Cite your sources here. all assets except the ground are from the phaser repository :https://github.com/photonstorm/phaser3-examples
                but the ground I found from https://opensource.com/article/18/7/put-platforms-python-game

        </ul>
        </li>

        <li>
            <strong>Prototype Closest Other Game:</strong>
            Which other game most closely resembles your game? If you are borrowing code from a Phaser Example, you must say so here. If you borrow code from elsewhere, you must say so here. mainly asteriods, and took code from a few different examples,

        <li>
            <strong>High Concept:</strong>
            A one-sentence summary of your game. control your ship during a meteor Shower dodge, and blast your way through.
        </li>

        <li>
            <strong>Theme:</strong>
            State which of the Storymatic themes you used.None
        </li>

        <li>
            <strong>Mandated Variety:</strong>
            State which input, randomness, genre, and play style you used in this prototype. The achiever play stlye was the main idea around this game.
        </li>

        <li>
            <strong>Prototype Goal:</strong>
            What game mechanic is this prototype evaluating? mainly flying with gravity, but also random spawn objstacles, and ranged wepaondry.
        </li>

        <li>
            <strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
            What experience do you want players to have when playing your game? challenging but worthwhile.
        </li>

        <li>
            <strong>Gameplay:</strong>
            you can steer the ship and shoot lazers that can destory incomming meteors, their is a 5 life limit but I was not able to get the the life counter yet. the meteors spawn randomly so it can get rough when the clump around you and the steering is not very easy to master. I i had more time i probably would have put in power ups, a title and restart screen as well.
        </li>

        <li>
            <strong>Strategies:</strong>
            What player strategies do you expect will be effective at playing this game? methodical play with pinpoint precision movements.
        </li>

        <li>
            <strong>Story/Setting/Premise:</strong>
            Mostly there is a meteor shower comming down on the planet and your ship is caught in the middle of it without any place to land.
        </li>

        <li>
            <strong>Target Audience:</strong>
