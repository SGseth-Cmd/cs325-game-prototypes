                <strong>Originality:</strong>
                What is original about your game? its a platformer that you make yourself.

            <li>
                <strong>Technical Merit:</strong>
                What is interesting about your game technology? iteration includes, limiting the number of boxes you can spawn over a given period of time, improved the player contorls(gravity and jump are faster) and increased the scale on the bullets to make them easier to see while also making doging harder.
            </li>

            <li>
                <strong>Prototype Postmortem:</strong>
                What did you learn from this prototype? how to use sounds and basics of platforming with some extra tweeks.
                What was the easiest or hardest part of making it? hard was making the boxes despawn correctly so that was hard, the easiest was implimenting sounds.
