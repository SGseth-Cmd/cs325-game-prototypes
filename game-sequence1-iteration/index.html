                <strong>Originality:</strong>
                What is original about your game? It takes the top down racing game adding in bumper mechanics to throw off your opponent
            </li>

            <li>
                <strong>Technical Merit:</strong>
                What is interesting about your game technology? getting good driving mechanics is difficult and requires a lot of trial and error on what the correct speeds should be.
            </li>

            <li>
                <strong>Prototype Postmortem:</strong>
                What did you learn from this prototype? that javascript is hard and I have a lot to learn, their are 3 ways to do something in phaser based on how you want to impliment it.
                What was the easiest or hardest part of making it? I learned about the different ways to make a sprite move via velocity or acceleration along with the angular variety as well. the car driving was very finiky to get right i still might want to tweek it.
                getting the second car working was by far the easiest.
